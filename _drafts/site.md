## Overview

It has been a long time since I have worked on any personal project that could be considered portfolio-worthy. As a result, I never bothered to maintain my website after getting a job at Michigan State University. However, as I start looking to transition into new opprotunities, it was appropriate to redo my entire website and make it something I plan on using for an extended period of time.
